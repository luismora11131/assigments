      <h3>
        I am a full time student at Medgar Evers College, my major is Computer
        Science and havent decide my branch yet. So far my journey have been fun
        beacuse I got to meet wonderful people on the way. The way I live life
        is by throwing myself into it, I tend to not make plans and take
        everything that comes in the way. Through the procces, I have learned
        how to become adaptable and aware of what I do.
